description: Minimal tutorial on making a simple website with GitHub Pages
---

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) provide a simple way to make a
website using
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and
[git](https://git-scm.com).

For me, the painful aspects of making a website are

- Working with html and css
- Finding a hosting site
- Transferring stuff to the hosting site


Start by reading the [Overview page](pages/overview.html), which
explains the basic structure of these sites. Then read
[how to make an independent website](pages/independent_site.html). Then
read any of the other things, such as
[how to test your site locally](pages/local_test.html).
